# Personal Portfolio Website: Michelle Zhang

## Description
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. This site showcases my background, professional experience, skills, and projects. This site's design provides a comprehensive overview of my professional and technical capabilities and serves as a dynamic resume and portfolio for potential employers, clients, and peers.

## Key Features
- **Hero Section**: A home component containing introductory information like bio, contact information, social media links, Resume and Projects buttons.
- **About Me**: A digital version of the resume with more information and details. Includes education, skills, professional experience, languages, and about me sections.
- **Projects**: Showcases the projects based on recency including buttons for links to source code, slide decks, and other documents about the project.
- **Contact Me**: A contact submission form for the user to submit inqueries or reach out. Also includes social media links, and other forms of communication.

## Technologies Used
- **Design**: Figma, LucidChart
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: JavaScript, Resend API
- **Testing**: Postman, Jest, Chrome DevTools, Codecov
- **Deployment and Hosting**: Vercel
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Development Process
1. **Planning**: Created a Project Document containing all information regarding the requirements, goals, target audience, scope, objectives, and tech stacks.
2. **Design**: Detailed a content outline of the site, a user flow diagram, wireframes, prototypes, and a style guide using `Figma` and `LucidChart`.
3. **Development**: Built the site using `React` components and used the `Next.js` framework for server-side rendering. Utilized the `Resend API` for backend email form submission implementation. Ensured proper code formatting and followed best formatting principles (`ESLint` and `Prettier`). Used `Git` and `GitHub` for version control.
4. **Styling**: Used `Tailwind CSS` for rapid UI development and consistent design. Implement responsive design and mobile-friendly UI. Used `Chrome DevTools` to help with styling.
5. **Testing**: Conducted through unit tests for each component to ensure `100%` code coverage (`Codecov`) and tested across various devices and browsers by adding features. Used `Postman` to test the backend API.
6. **Deployment**: Utilized `Vercel` for seamless deployment and Continuous Integration and Continuous Development(CICD).

## Challenges and Solutions
1. **Design**: The first time using tools such as `Figma` and `LucidChart` to create wireframes and prototypes before starting the implementation of the project.
    - **Solution**: Watched tutorials and learned the tools before applying them to this project. Thoroughly explored around with the interfaces in depth.
2. **Backend Implementation**: The first time using the `Resend API` and I had little experience working with APIs.
    - **Solution**: Tried a *trial and error* approach to the backend implementation while also reading the documentation.
3. **Responsive Design**: The first time using `Tailwind CSS` and relied on it heavily for responsive design. I also needed to alter the initial design of the site to accommodate for smaller devices especially mobile.
    - **Solution**: Designed as I coded and did a little bit of *trail and error* with the design for minimized screens. Relied on the benefits of using `Tailwind CSS`. Implemented the hamburger navbar, standard for responsive navbars.
4. **Deployment**: The first time using `Vercel` to deploy and host the site. Also, first time purchasing a domain for the site and email contact form submissions.
    - **Solution**: Purchased the domain on *GoDaddy* and followed instructions and documentation on how to connect the domain to the site through `Vercel`.
5. **Unit Tests and Code Coverage**: The first time writing unit test coverage for a personal project. The first time using `Codecov` to ensure 100% code coverage.
    - **Solution**: `Codecov` was helpful in specifying which lines had and did not have unit test coverage as well as indicate which lines had weak coverage. The goal was always to ensure 100% coverage. Struggled with `Jest` configurations but managed to debug that part.
